Sesame continues to add new features to help you better manage ingress operations in a cluster.
Our latest feature release, Sesame 1.11.0, now includes support for a new operator aimed at managing the lifecycle of Sesame and its corresponding Envoy instances.

## Sesame Operator

__FEATURE STATE:__ Sesame v1.11.0 [alpha](https://projectsesame.io/resources/deprecation-policy/)

[Sesame Operator](https://github.com/projectsesame/sesame-operator/blob/main/README.md) provides a method for packaging,
deploying, and managing Sesame. The operator extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and
manage instances of Sesame on behalf of users.
It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts, but includes domain-specific knowledge to automate the entire lifecycle of Sesame.

In Kubernetes, controllers of the control-plane implement control loops that repeatedly compare the desired state of the cluster to its actual state.
If the cluster's actual state doesn’t match the desired state, then the controller takes action to fix the problem.
Sesame Operator is a custom Kubernetes controller that uses the `Sesame` custom resource (CR) to manage Sesame and its dependent components, i.e. the Envoy DaemonSet.
The `Sesames.operator.projectsesame.io` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) defines the `Sesame` CR. A `Sesame` is handled by the Kubernetes API just like built-in objects, including interaction via kubectl and inclusion in role-based access control (RBAC) policies.
The following example runs an instance of Sesame in namespace `projectsesame` with 2 Deployment replicas:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operator.projectsesame.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sesame
metadata:
  name: Sesame-sample
spec: {}
EOF
```

No configuration, i.e. `spec`, is provided since `projectsesame` is the default namespace and `2` is the default number
of replicas for a `Sesame`.
The default parameters of the `Sesame` can be verified in the same way as any other Kubernetes resource:
```
$ kubectl get Sesame/sesame-sample -o yaml
apiVersion: operator.projectsesame.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sesame
metadata:
  name: Sesame-sample
  namespace: default
...
spec:
  namespace:
    name: projectsesame
    removeOnDeletion: false
  replicas: 2
...
```

Sesame Operator continues to monitor the `Sesame` CR and provides status on whether the actual state matches the desired state. The following example indicates the `Sesame` is available:
```
$ kubectl get Sesame/sesame-sample
NAME             READY   REASON
Sesame-sample   True    SesameAvailable
```

The `Sesame` is now ready to start serving `Ingress` and `HTTPProxy` resources.

Check out the [Getting Started](https://projectsesame.io/getting-started/) guide to learn how to start managing Sesame using the operator. Learn more about the planned features of Sesame Operator by reviewing the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/projectsesame/sesame-operator/issues).

## XDS Resource `v2` Removed

As mentioned in Sesame [1.10](https://projectsesame.io/sesame_v1100/#envoy-xds-v3-support) the v2 XDS resource version has been removed from Sesame ahead of its removal from Envoy.
Please see the [XDS Migration Guide](https://projectsesame.io/guides/xds-migration/) for upgrading your instances of Envoy/sesame.

Also note that this change applies to any External Auth servers that may be integrated, they need to support XDS version `v3` with this release of Sesame.
