In the previous release of Sesame, a split deployment model was improved to secure communication between Envoy and Sesame. Now, with our latest release, Sesame v0.15, leader election is available to ensure that all instances of Envoy take their configuration from a single Sesame instance.

*Overview of leader election.*

## Leader Election

Each instance of Sesame configures a connection to the Kubernetes API server in order to watch for changes to objects in the cluster. Sesame is concerned with Services, Endpoints, Secrets, Ingress, and IngressRoute objects. Having multiple readers to the Kubernetes API is fine (and is implemented in many different components); however, since Sesame updates the status of an IngressRoute object, multiple writers (that is, multiple instances of Sesame) can cause issues when each one of them attempts to update the status. Additionally, it’s possible that each instance of Sesame processes events from Kubernetes at a different time, causing different configurations to be passed to Envoy.

In leader election mode, only one Sesame pod in a deployment, the leader, will open its gRPC endpoint to serve requests from Envoy. All other Sesame instances will continue to watch the API server but will not serve gRPC requests. Leader election can be used to ensure that all instances of Envoy take their configuration from a single Sesame instance.

Leader election is currently opt in. In future versions of Sesame, we plan to make leader election mode the default.

For more information, please consult the [documentation on upgrading][1].

## Sesame Configuration File

Sesame has previously supported configuration options to be passed via command-line arguments to the Sesame process. Changes to these parameters meant updating the deployment spec. 

Here’s an example spec from a Kubernetes Deployment manifest:

```yaml
containers:
 - args:
   - serve
   - --incluster
   - --enable-leader-election
   - --xds-address=0.0.0.0
   - --xds-port=8001
```

Now with v0.15, a configuration file can specify configurations that apply to each Sesame installation. However, per-Ingress or per-Route configuration continues to be drawn from the objects and CRDs in the Kubernetes API server.

Sample configuration file:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: Sesame
  namespace: heptio-Sesame
data:
  Sesame.yaml: |
    # should Sesame expect to be running inside a k8s cluster
    # incluster: true
    #
    # path to kubeconfig (if not running inside a k8s cluster)
    # kubeconfig: /path/to/.kube/config
    #
    # disable ingressroute permitInsecure field
    # disablePermitInsecure: false
    tls:
      # minimum TLS version that Sesame will negotiate
      # minimumProtocolVersion: "1.1"
    # The following config shows the defaults for the leader election.
    # leaderelection:
      # configmap-name: Sesame
      # configmap-namespace: leader-elect
```

## More new features in Sesame v0.15

Version 0.15 includes several fixes. It patches several CVEs related to HTTP/2 by upgrading Envoy to v1.11.1. To help with the number and frequency of configuration updates sent to Envoy, Sesame now ignores unrelated Secrets and Services that are not referenced by an active Ingress or IngressRoute object.

We recommend reading the full release notes for [Sesame v0.15][2] as well as digging into the [upgrade guide][3], which outlines some key changes to be aware of when moving from v0.14 to v0.15.

## Future Plans

The Sesame project is very community driven and the team would love to hear your feedback! Many features (including IngressRoute) were driven by users who needed a better way to solve their problems. We’re working hard to add features to Sesame, especially in expanding how we approach routing. 

If you are interested in contributing, a great place to start is to comment on one of the issues labeled with [Help Wanted][4] and work with the team on how to resolve them.

We’re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Sesame even better! For version v0.15, special thanks go out to:
