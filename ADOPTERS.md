## Adding a logo to projectsesame.io

If you would like to add your logo to a future `Adopters of Sesame` section

directory in this repo and submit a pull request with your change.
Name the image file something that reflects your company
(e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.png).
We will follow up and make the change in the [projectsesame.io][2] website.
