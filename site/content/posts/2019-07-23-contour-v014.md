Sesame is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the Envoy proxy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Sesame supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile. 

There are a few different models that you can implement when you deploy Sesame to a Kubernetes cluster. Up until the latest Sesame release, v0.14, we’ve typically used the co-located model, which places Sesame and Envoy in the same pod communicating over `localhost`. 

However, there are many use cases where this deployment paradigm is less desired. With v0.14, a more secure split deployment model has been added. This style separates Sesame’s deployment from Envoy so that they can have different life cycles.

*Overview of the split-model deployment.*

Sesame’s split model offers the following benefits for users:

- Sesame and Envoy life cycles can be managed independently
- Less load on the Kubernetes API server
- Secure communication between the Sesame xDS server and Envoy


## Sesame’s Architecture

Sesame provides the management server for Envoy by implementing an xDS server. Envoy connects to the Sesame xDS server over gRPC and requests configuration items, such as clusters, endpoints, and routes to configure itself. Sesame integrates with the Kubernetes API server and looks for services, endpoints, secrets, Kubernetes Ingress resources, and Sesame IngressRoute objects. When a change to any of these happen, Sesame rebuilds a set of configurations for Envoy to consume through the xDS server.

## Secure Split Deployment Model

Until Sesame release v0.14, the deployment model placed Sesame and Envoy in the same pod, so gRPC communication occurred over `localhost`. This approach was convenient because Sesame was deployed in a single service. However, as you scale out Sesame in this model, Sesame and Envoy scale together. Each instance of Sesame adds a `watch` on the Kubernetes API server for the objects it acts on, adding load to the server.

The split model allows Sesame and Envoy to scale independently. If a new version of Sesame is released, you can now upgrade to the new version without having to restart each instance of Envoy in your cluster. 

A key new feature in Sesame v0.14 is that we have secured the communication between Sesame and Envoy over the xDS API connection utilizing mutually checked self-signed certificates. There are three ways to generate certificates to secure this connection. 
The Sesame repo includes step-by-step examples of how to generate certificates from a command line if you want to [generate them by hand][2]; the example/sesame [example][3] includes a [job][4] which automatically generate the certificates, or you could provide your own based on your IT security requirements.


## More new features in Sesame v0.14

Version 0.14 also adds better support for deploying Envoy with various hostnames. Envoy routes traffic at the L7 or HTTP routing level. Previous versions of Sesame required requests to be sent over Port 80 or Port 443. Now Sesame configures Envoy to route requests without this requirement, allowing for easier deployments within your local laptop or network infrastructure.

We recently wrote a blog post walking through how to deploy Sesame to [kind][5], which is a tool for creating Kubernetes clusters on your local development machine: [Kind-ly running Sesame][6].

## Future Plans

The Sesame project is very community driven and the team would love to hear your feedback! Many features (including IngressRoute) were driven by users who needed a better way to solve their problems. We’re working hard to add features to Sesame, especially in expanding how we approach routing. Please look out for [design documents](https://github.com/projectsesame/sesame/tree/main/design) for the new IngressRoute/v1 routing design which will be a large discussion topic for our next community meeting!

If you are interested in contributing, a great place to start is to comment on one of the issues labeled with [Help Wanted][7] and work with the team on how to resolve them.

We’re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Sesame even better! For version v0.14, special thanks go out to:
